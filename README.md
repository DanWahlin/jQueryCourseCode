Mastering jQuery Course Code
==========

This code is used in the Mastering jQuery class offered by Wahlin Consulting (training@wahlinconsulting.com).

The majority of the labs can be completed using any editor (Brackets, WebStorm, SublimeText, Visual Studio Code, etc.).

Labs that require a "real" backend API and database require Visual Studio 2015 Community edition to be installed (MSSqlLocalDB is used as the database).
